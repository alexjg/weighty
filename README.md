# Weighty - simple workout tracker

When I track my workouts I want to do three things:

1. Record the weight, reps, and [RPE](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/autoregulation/) of each set of each exercise
2. View a history of each exercise so I can compete with my past self
3. Not feed a gigantic surveilance capitalism engine 

So, this is a stupid simple, open-source, workout tracking app. It works for me. It contains many bugs and no instructions on how to use it.
